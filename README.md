# Listicle Heading #

A CKEditor plugin for Drupal 8 and to create \<h2\> headings preceded by a number and a dot.

## Example ##

Using the CKEditor plugin you can enter a number and the heading text. This would be the source code created:

```
<h2 class="listing" data-number="1">My Sample Heading</h2>
```

With the Listicle Heading Filter enabled this would be the rendered content:

### 1. &nbsp;My Sample Heading ###

```
<h2 class="listing">1. &nbsp;My Sample Heading</h2>
```
